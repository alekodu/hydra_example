        | This is the front page of the consumer app. There are several example included in this app:
    ul
        if (backends.introspect)
            li
                a#introspection(href="/articles/secure-backend-with-oauth2-token-introspection")
                    code /articles/secure-backend-with-oauth2-token-introspection
                | : Opening this article will first request an OAuth 2.0 Access Token from you and then make requests
                | to the backend ("resource server"). The backend performs the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection flow to validate
                | the access token and, if the token is valid, will return some data.
